<h2>Important Concepts</h2>

<section>
  <p>Here are some concepts we believe are important to know:
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Serializer</b>: It has the responsibility to transform the value retrieved from the model to the one actually
    will be
    set in the QPs. The serializer is needed because all the values send to the QP most be string and all model values
    are not going to be necessarily strings, so a preprocessor for those cases was needed to be introduced.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Deserializer</b>: It's the opposite of the Serializer, it transforms the value retrieved from the QPs to the
    value that will be set in the model.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Query Parameter(s) or QP(s)</b>: Is a part of a uniform resource locator (URL) that assigns values to specified
    parameters. A query string commonly includes fields added to a base URL by a Web browser or other client
    application. Whole concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string">here</a>.

  <h3>Extends ReactiveForms API</h3>
  <p> The main classes and services in ng-ui2qp almost fully match Angular's ReactiveForms which makes it familiar and
    easy to
    understand and use.</p>
  <p>Here is how ng-ui2qp matches ReactiveForms API</p>
  <table class="text-align-center">
    <tr class="primary-background-color accent-color">
      <th>ReactiveForms Class</th>
      <th>Ui2Qp Class</th>

    </tr>
    <tr class="light-primary-background-color">
      <td>FormControl</td>
      <td>Ui2QpFormControl</td>
      <td>Extends</td>

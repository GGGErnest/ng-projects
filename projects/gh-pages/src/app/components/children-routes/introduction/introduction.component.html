<h2>ng-ui2qp</h2>

<section class="">
  <p>Angular library that serializes the state of UI components as query parameters(QPs) and vice verse.</p>
</section>

<h2>Description</h2>

<section class="">
  <p>The lib provides a way of synchronize UI components state into query parameters(QPs) using a declarative and
    familiar approach, it extends ReactiveForm's API.
    Using the library's features could improve the user experience in some ways, think about the following use cases:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Accidentally or intentionally refreshing the page will keep the last state of the app which prevents the user
      lose the data entered. In mobiles, refreshing the page accidentally happens very commonly.
    </li>
    <li>If you want to bookmark or share specific states of the application, you could do it simply copying the url
      and sending it to who you want or bookmarking the page which guarantees you to restore the page exactly how was.
    </li>
  </ul>
